<span style="font-size: 17px;">**Description**</span>  
Concentration is a classic card-matching game that challenges your memory and concentration. The game consists of a set of face-down cards, and the objective is to find pairs of matching cards by flipping them over two at a time. The game is won when all the pairs have been successfully matched.

 When you start the game, you'll be presented with a grid of 36 face-down cards.
Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal their content.
If the two cards match, they will remain face-up, and you'll earn a point.
If the cards do not match, they will be flipped back face-down.
Continue to find matching pairs until all cards are face-up, and you win the game. The game begins with an initial score of 20, and if your score reaches zero, the game is over.

- Step 1: Open the link https://elliesolhjou.github.io/MemoryGame/
- Step 2: Your objective is to match all the pairs in the 6x6 grid as quickly as possible.
- Step 3: On your turn, you'll flip over two cards by selecting their positions on the grid (e.g., "Row 1, Column 3" and "Row 4, Column 2").
- Step 4: If the two cards you flip over match in terms of their images or designs, you've found a pair. Remove those two cards from the grid and set them aside.
