<span style="font-size: 17px;">**Description**</span>  
Concentration is a classic card-matching game that challenges your memory and concentration. The game consists of a set of face-down cards, and the objective is to find pairs of matching cards by flipping them over two at a time. The game is won when all the pairs have been successfully matched.

<span style="font-size: 17px;">**Gameplay / User Experience** </span>  
 When you start the game, you'll be presented with a grid of 36 face-down cards.
Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal their content.
If the two cards match, they will remain face-up, and you'll earn a point.
If the cards do not match, they will be flipped back face-down.
Continue to find matching pairs until all cards are face-up, and you win the game. The game begins with an initial score of 20, and if your score reaches zero, the game is over.
